Because you are cloning a Github repository that only we can push to, you should **NEVER EDIT** any of the files you pull from Github. Instead, what you should do, is either make a new notebook and write your solutions in there, or **make a copy of this notebook and save it somewhere else** on your computer, not inside the `sds` folder that you cloned, so you can write your answers in there. If you edit the notebook you pulled from Github, those edits (possible your solutions to the exercises) may be overwritten and lost the next time you pull from Github.
